### Hi there, I'm Alexander Ivanov ðŸ‘‹

Since the beginning of 2023 I've been actively studying data analysis, Python and SQL. Recently I've successfully finished Yandex Practicum 7 months data analysis course. You can check here some of the projects I made during studying at Yandex Practicum: https://github.com/AlexResearcher/data_analysis.\
I've more than 6 years experience in investment consultancy and analysis but i've switched to more desirable field which is data analysis.\
I'm actively seeking for a job in data analysis and will continue to improve my skills and knowledge in this field.
